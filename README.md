# SimpleBusiness

Simple Business Simulator is a simple game that simulates a business from its creation to its domination of the economy. Players can choose from a variety of different items to sell, as well as diversify into selling other items, buy factories to produce the items, etc.

Developed on Windows 10 using [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/). compiled using GCC from MinGW32, version control managed using [git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

Important information for Code::Blocks users:
The included Code::Blocks project files may not work on Windows if they are downloaded from the Github website since Git changes all the LFs to CRLFs upon commit, and Code::Blocks doesn't load the project once the project files use CRLFs. Checking out the project using Git should automatically convert the line endings back to your platform's scheme, which Code::Blocks should be compatible with, but there are no guarantees since I only know how the IDE behaves on Windows.
